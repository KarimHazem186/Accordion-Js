# Accordion-Js
A simple and responsive **accordion component** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This interactive UI element allows users to expand and collapse content sections, ideal for FAQs, menus, or any grouped information.

## ðŸ§© Demo Structure

The accordion includes:
- Three toggleable sections (`Section 1`, `Section 2`, `Section 3`)
- Hidden content inside each section revealed on click
- Smooth transition using basic CSS animations

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used

- **HTML5** 
- **CSS3** 
- **JavaScript** 

## âœ¨ Features

- Toggle accordion panels on button click
- Clean, minimal, and responsive layout
- Easy to expand with more sections
- Beginner-friendly and great for learning DOM manipulation

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. Each section is a `<button>` followed by a `<div>` containing the content.
2. JavaScript selects all `.accordion` buttons and adds a click listener.
3. When clicked, the associated content `<div class="desc">` is toggled (shown/hidden).
4. You can optionally modify the script to allow only one open section at a time.
